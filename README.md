## Introduction

In statistics, the arithmetic mean is a common measure of central tendency. It provides a simple average of a set of values. However, when working with large datasets or strided arrays, calculating the mean can become complex. This repository addresses that complexity with a two-pass error correction algorithm.

## Features

- Efficient calculation of the arithmetic mean for strided arrays.
- Two-pass error correction to improve accuracy.
- Easy to integrate with JavaScript and Node.js applications.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hiugiygiygbiu/stats-strided-meanpn.git
cd stats-strided-meanpn
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To use the `stats-strided-meanpn` library, you can import it into your JavaScript or Node.js application as follows:

```javascript
const { stridedMean } = require('stats-strided-meanpn');

// Example usage
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const stride = 1;
const mean = stridedMean(data, stride);
console.log(`The mean is: ${mean}`);
```

For detailed examples and additional usage scenarios, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/hiugiygiygbiu/stats-strided-meanpn/releases).

## Algorithm Overview

The two-pass error correction algorithm works as follows:

1. **First Pass**: Calculate the initial mean by summing the elements of the strided array and dividing by the number of elements.
2. **Second Pass**: Adjust the mean based on the error calculated in the first pass. This step ensures that any discrepancies are corrected, leading to a more accurate result.

This approach is particularly useful for large datasets where precision is critical.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Calculation

```javascript
const data = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
const stride = 1;
const mean = stridedMean(data, stride);
console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Output: Mean: 30
```

### Example 2: Strided Calculation

```javascript
const data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const stride = 2; // Every second element
const mean = stridedMean(data, stride);
console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Output: Mean: 5.5
```

### Example 3: Large Dataset

```javascript
const largeData = Array.from({ length: 1000000 }, (_, i) => i + 1);
const stride = 1;
const mean = stridedMean(largeData, stride);
console.log(`Mean: ${mean}`); // Output: Mean: 500000.5
```
